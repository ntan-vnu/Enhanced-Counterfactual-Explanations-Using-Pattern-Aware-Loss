Enhanced Counterfactual Explanations Using Pattern Aware Loss for Medical Image Classification

The modifications made to the original code are clearly presented in our paper entitled "Enhanced Counterfactual Explanations Using Pattern Aware Loss for Medical Image Classification". These changes are detailed to provide clarity on how the enhancements align with the study's goals and methodologies. In the study, the authors propose a methodology to discover learned patterns of diseases in medical images and to improve counterfactual explanations using a proposed pattern-aware loss.

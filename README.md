Enhanced Counterfactual Explanations Using Pattern Aware Loss for Medical Image Classification

The project is implemented regarding the proposed methodology presented in the paper entitled "Enhanced Counterfactual Explanations Using Pattern Aware Loss for Medical Image Classification". In the research, the authors propose a methodology to discover learned patterns of diseases in medical images and to improve counterfactual explanations using a proposed pattern-aware loss.
